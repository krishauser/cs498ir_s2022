    "## Problem 1: Reaching antipodal grasps\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem 1 asks to find gripper transforms that match *antipodal grasps*.  An antipodal graph defines a line segment that a gripper could plausibly use for closing onto the geometry.  Here we will use the `AntipodalGrasp` data structure to represent such a grasp.  The key defining parameters of an antipodal grasp include the center of the line segment and its axis.  You should match this to the *closure axis* of the gripper, which is the direction in which the fingers will close down on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gripper itself is represented as a [GripperInfo](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/klampt.model.robotinfo.html#klampt.model.robotinfo.GripperInfo) data structure. For visualization purposes, we get the value `gripper_geom` which is a Klamp't [Geometry3D](http://motion.cs.illinois.edu/software/klampt/latest/pyklampt_docs/klampt.robotsim.html#klampt.Geometry3D) instance.  You don't need to know the details of these objects for the purpose of completing this problem, but these details may be helpful in later problems."
